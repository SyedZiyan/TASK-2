## Overview of Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning is a subdiscipline within machine learning, where such an agent would learn how it is expected to take actions in an environment to maximise cumulative rewards. It has origins within behavioral psychology and learns through interactions rather than through explicit instructions.
## Key concepts in Reinforcement Learning
Agent: the learner or decision-maker interacting with an environment.
Environment: An environment in which the agent acts, creating states and rewards according to the action.
State: The state of the environment .
Action: A decision an agent makes that alters the state.
Reward: It is an environment's response and can be defined as the outcome of performing some action .
Policy(P): A policy describes a strategy for how the agent should act at any given time.
Value Function: this is an estimate of the cumulative reward that is expected from a certain state or action.
Q-function: this is a type of value function that estimates expected rewards achievable by taking a particular action in a particular state.
## Types of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
## Model-Based RL:
Builds a model of the environment's dynamics.
Aims to make decisions by simulating potential outcomes using the model.
## Model-Free RL:
Learns from experience directly, without building any model.
## Value-Based Methods: 
Learn the value of actions. Examples include Q-learning.
## Policy-Based Methods:
Learn the policy directly-for example Proximal Policy Optimization.
## Benefits of Reinforcement Learning
## Autonomous Learning:
RL agents learn and develop over time, resulting in a slight need for human intervention
## Personalized Solutions:
Adaptability to user behavior allows for personalized recommendations and strategies.
## Exploration vs. Exploitation:
Balancing trying new actions to discover rewards, and leveraging known actions to maximize the reward.
Disadvantages of Reinforcement Learning
## Sample Efficiency:
has to be learned after many interactions with the environment, which could prove pricey in life end applications.
## Credit Assignment Problem: 
Difficulty to identify which actions yielded some received rewards, particularly when feedback is delayed.
## Non-Stationary Environments:
Changes in environment may cause policies learned prior to become useless.
## Lack of Interpretability:
Policies learned can be highly complex and not easily understandable, particularly in critical applications.
Reinforcement Learning - Applications
## Gaming:
Artificial intelligence that will beat the human brain in complex games
Autonomous Vehicles: Systems governing self-driving cars and drones.
## Healthcare:
Customized treatment and surgery aid
## Finance:
Investment strategies and portfolio optimization
## Robotics:
Education of adaptive learning for robot on complex tasks
## Conclusion
Reinforcement Learning is one of the pivotal approaches through which fully intelligible systems with capabilities of decision-making could be developed in dynamic and complex environments. Its applications are multifariously widespread and seem to be a method whose potential and growth appears to be harvested through the various advances in technologies.
